# SudokuSolver-Android

Android application that uses OCR to scan and regonize sudoku puzzles, and then solve them, overlaying the solution to the scanned puzzle. We are also going to be implementing various sudoku solving algorithms in which we can record and compare time complexity for each to determine the most efficienct sudoku solving algorithm.
